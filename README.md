# lucifR
Lucene Interface for R

This project is a demonstration to show how Rjava can be used to access a Java library from R and make use of it simply.
The 3 main things you can currently do with this package are index data frames to a lucene index by column, search columns with a MultiFieldQueryParser, and parse R strings using Lucene analyzers.
